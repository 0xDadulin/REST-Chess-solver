# REST Chess Solver

Welcome to the REST Chess Solver API! This Flask-based web service allows you to find available moves for various chess pieces from any given position on a standard chess board.

## Features

- **Get Available Moves:** You can fetch the available moves for any of the standard chess pieces (King, Queen, Bishop, Rook, Knight, and Pawn) from a given position.
- **Validate Moves:** Validate if a specific move is legal for a given chess piece from a given position to a destination.

## How to Use

### Available Moves Endpoint

To get available moves for a chess piece from a given position:

/api/v1/<chess_figure>/<current_field>

For example:

/api/v1/queen/e4

### Validate Move Endpoint

To validate if a move is legal for a given chess piece from a given position to a destination:

/api/v1/<chess_figure>/<current_field>/<dest_field>

For example:

/api/v1/queen/e4/g6
